Fraudulent transactions as a result of compromised credit cards and phishing attacks on merchant terminals pose a great challenge for businesses, payment providers and consumers. With the increasing number of card transactions, it is almost impossible for financial institutions to check and detect fraudulent transactions manually. Hence, payment providers are increasingly relying on machine learning techniques and models to screen through the vast amount of transactions and flag suspicious transactions for further investigations by humans.

One of the big tasks in cyber data analytics is detecting malicious or fraudulent data records. This is a machine learning task that is extra complicated due to several properties of the data and its domain:

- The large majority (typically over 99%) of the data is benign
- The data comes from individuals, whose privacy needs to be protected
- Malicious users actively try to hide
- The amount of data to learn from is enormous
- Often this data is unlabeled

In this challenge, we seek to design a credit card fraud detection system that is able to detect fraudulent transactions in the dataset.
